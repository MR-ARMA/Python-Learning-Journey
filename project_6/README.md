# Project: Number Gesser Game 1 🎲

Welcome to an engaging and exciting game that challenges users to guess a number randomly generated by the system. With every incorrect guess, the game provides helpful hints, guiding the user towards the correct answer. But there's a twist - the user's final score diminishes with each hint requested. This combination of strategy and deduction will keep players on their toes and eager to prove their number-guessing prowess! 

## Objective 

The goal of this project is to create a captivating game that includes the following key elements:

1. Generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100). 🎲
2. Allows the user to make a guess. 🔍
3. Provides hints to guide the user towards the correct number if their guess is incorrect. 💡
4. Deducts from the user's score with every incorrect guess. 📉
5. Concludes when the user correctly deduces the number or decides to end the game. 🏁

## Requirements 📝

To successfully complete this project, you should:

1. Organize your project with a clear directory and file structure. 📁
2. Implement a scoring system. 🏆
3. Provide user-friendly messages and hints. 🗣️
4. Validate the user's input. ✅

## Best Practices 💡

Here are some tips to consider while developing your game:

- Break down the game into smaller components or modules. 🧩
- Encapsulate different functionalities using functions or classes. 🔧
- Test each component separately before integrating them. 🧪

## Pros and Cons 👍👎

This game structure has the following advantages and disadvantages:

### Pros 👍

- Simple and straightforward structure. 
- Easy to understand, even for beginners. 

### Cons 👎

- Lacks modularity, making it harder to maintain and expand. 
- All code is lumped together, which can lead to confusion as the project grows. 

## Solution 🔧

To address the cons, consider the following improvements:

- Refactor your code into smaller, more manageable modules. This will make your code easier to understand and maintain. 
- Implement a more robust validation system for user input. This will help prevent errors and improve the user experience.
