# <center>Project: Number Gesser Game 2

## Description
Create an engaging and entertaining game that presents users with the exciting challenge of guessing a number randomly generated by the system. With each incorrect guess, players are provided with helpful hints to guide them towards the elusive answer, but there's a twist - their final score diminishes with each hint they request. This dynamic combination of strategy and deduction will keep players on their toes and eager to prove their number-guessing prowess!

## Objective
Your mission is to craft a captivating game encompassing the following key elements:

1. The game artfully conjures a random number within a specified range (for instance, between 1 and 100).

2. The user is invited to venture a guess at this mysterious number.

3. With every erroneous guess, the user is gently guided by the provision of hints, revealing whether the enigmatic number resides in a higher or lower domain relative to their conjecture.

4. The user's score is inextricably tied to their accuracy; every misguided guess leads to a decrement in their score.

5. The game's suspenseful journey culminates when the user astutely deduces the concealed number or gracefully decides to conclude their quest.

6. For each `user input` that not valid (not integer), hint is 5 point



## Requirement

1. Organize your project with a clear directory and file structure.
2. Implement a scoring system.
3. Provide user-friendly messages and hints.
4. Ensure the user's input is validated.

## Tips

- Think about how you can break down the game into smaller components or modules.
- Consider using functions or classes to encapsulate different functionalities.
- Test each component separately before integrating them .

## Solution

- Pros:
    - Straightforward and simple structure.
    - Easy to understand for beginners.
- Cons:
    - Lacks modularity, making it harder to maintain and expand.
    - All code is lumped together, which can be confusing as the project grows.
