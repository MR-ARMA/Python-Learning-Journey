# Palindrome Checker 🔍🎯

This repository contains a simple Python program that checks if a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Features 

- The program is case-insensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.
- It can handle single-character words and empty strings as palindromes.
- It provides clear and immediate feedback - printing "yes!" if the input word is a palindrome and "no!" if it's not.

## Usage 📖

To use this program, simply run the Python script and enter a word when prompted. The program will then check if the word is a palindrome and print the result.
