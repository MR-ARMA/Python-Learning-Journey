# Finding Numbers in a Haystack 📚🔍

This project is all about extracting numbers from a text file and adding them up. The text file is filled with numbers hidden among a sea of text. Your task is to find these numbers and calculate their sum. 🧮🎯

## Project Overview 👀

This project is designed to parse a text file filled with both text and numbers. The goal is to extract all the numbers from the text and compute their sum. 📝🔢

## Data Files 📁

We provide two data files for this project:
two big text file that Uploaded with names file_1 and file_2


These files should be saved in the same directory as your Python program. 📂💾

## Data Format 📄

The text file is filled with text and numbers. The numbers are scattered throughout the text. Your task is to identify these numbers, extract them, and add them up. The numbers can appear anywhere in the line and there can be any number of numbers in each line. 📝🔢

## How to Run the Program 🚀

The basic outline of the program is as follows:

1. Read the file
2. Use the `re.findall()` function to look for integers
3. Convert the extracted strings to integers
4. Sum up the integers

To run the program, simply execute the Python script in your terminal. 💻🔄
