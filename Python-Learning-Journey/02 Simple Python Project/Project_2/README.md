## About the Game 

The traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors is a two-player game, in which each player simultaneously chooses, either rock, paper, or scissors. The game is based on the following rules:

- Rock crushes scissors ✊
- Scissors cut paper ✌️
- Paper covers rock ✋

The winner is decided based on these rules. If you are familiar with the popular TV Series, The Big Bang Theory, you might know another version of the game called Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. This repository supports both versions of the game.

## Prerequisites 

- Python 3.x

## Installation 💻


## Usage 🎮

The game prompts you to enter your choice of 'R' for Rock, 'P' for Paper, or 'S' for Scissors. The game will then randomly select an option for the computer and determine the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors. If the user's choice and the computer's choice are the same, it's a tie. If the user's choice and the computer's choice follow the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (Rock smashes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock), the computer wins. If the user's choice follows the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock smashes Scissors), the user wins.

To exit the game, enter 'EXIT'.
